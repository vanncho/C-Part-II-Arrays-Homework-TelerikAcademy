Homework: Arrays

Problem 1. Allocate array
Write a program that allocates array of 20 integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by 5.
Print the obtained array on the console.

Problem 2. Compare arrays
Write a program that reads two integer arrays from the console and compares them element by element.

Problem 3. Compare char arrays
Write a program that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).

Problem 4. Maximal sequence
Write a program that finds the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array.
Example:

input	result
2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1	2, 2, 2

Problem 5. Maximal increasing sequence
Write a program that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array.
Example:

input	result
3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4	2, 3, 4

Problem 6. Maximal K sum
Write a program that reads two integer numbers N and K and an array of N elements from the console.
Find in the array those K elements that have maximal sum.

Problem 7. Selection sort
Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order. Write a program to sort an array.
Use the Selection sort algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.

Problem 8. Maximal sum
Write a program that finds the sequence of maximal sum in given array.
Example:

input	result
2, 3, -6, -1, 2, -1, 6, 4, -8, 8	2, -1, 6, 4
Can you do it with only one loop (with single scan through the elements of the array)?

Problem 9. Frequent number
Write a program that finds the most frequent number in an array.
Example:

input	result
4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 4, 9, 3	4 (5 times)

Problem 10. Find sum in array
Write a program that finds in given array of integers a sequence of given sum S (if present).
Example:

array	S	result
4, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 8	11	4, 2, 5

Problem 11. Binary search
Write a program that finds the index of given element in a sorted array of integers by using the Binary search algorithm.

Problem 12. Index of letters
Write a program that creates an array containing all letters from the alphabet (A-Z).
Read a word from the console and print the index of each of its letters in the array.

Problem 13.* Merge sort
Write a program that sorts an array of integers using the Merge sort algorithm.

Problem 14. Quick sort
Write a program that sorts an array of integers using the Quick sort algorithm.
